# Crowdfunding-ETL

##Overview
For this project, I worked with Independent Funding, which is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects and ventures. Since the company is trying to move its data from a large Excel file into a PostgreSQL Database, I had to use ETL to perform my analysis.

##Summary
1. I started by using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to "Extract" the data from the original Excel file.
2. While in Jupyter Notebook, I also "Transformed" the data as needed and created CSV files.
3. In order to build the PostgreSQL Database, I created an ERD, which allowed me to form tables.
4. I then "Loaded" the CSV files into the corresponding tables within the PostgreSQL Database.
5. With the new Database, I could then easily create additional tables and files, which Independent Funding might need for future reports.

##Results
In then end, I was very pleased with the Database and I believe Independent Funding will be much more efficient with its data.
